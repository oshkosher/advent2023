Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

To get input files (my code assumes their filenames will be in the form day\<n\>.in.txt) log in to adventofcode and download each one. 
Advent of Code is engineered so that different users get different input files and different solution values, so yours probably
won't match mine, and my code might fail on other inputs.

TODO:
- test code on other inputs by making a few different login ids
- speed up day23
- self-contained solution for day 25 (rather than solving visually)
- solve day 24 without using sympy
